  <h2 id="aboutH2">A bit about me</h2>
  <h3>A few reasons why I moved from my typical 9 - 5 job to Freelancing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>There was no time independence in my job</li>
    <li>No Financial independence</li>
    <li>I wasn't paid according to my amount of work done and skillset</li>
    <li>I wanted to be my own boss and take control over my life</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why I founded <a href="adrolancer.html">Adrolancer</a>?</h3>
  <p  class="adrodef">The vision was to <strong>emphasize</strong> on helping people and businesses using my <strong>skillset</strong>. After working for 4 years
    at an MNC, I was kind of lost and it forced me to think about what I actually wanted from life. I wanted to have a different life, a life with
    more freedom and a greater purpose. I realised that help is proportional to building wealth. Society demands help with a lot of things. People want
    a better lifestyle which is possible by many means, one of which is through technology. Providing the society with better tech would help me create
    wealth which in turn would help the society make people's lives easier. <strong>Consistency</strong> and <strong>Efficiency</strong> are the keys
    that would help the seed I have sown to make people's lives better. It would bring more power to the people by transforming their ideas into
    something more productive with the help of powerful and efficient online presense/personal or business websites.
